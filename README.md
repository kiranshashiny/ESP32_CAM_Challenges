# ESP32_CAM_Challenges Faced on Mac OS  June 14th 2023


Troubleshooting tips.

Connect the GPIO0 and the GND to upload code - or else it wont work.

Press the on-board RST button on the back side to start uploading -or else it wont work.

Use Arduino 2 IDE instead of Arduino 1.x.x IDE - has the " AI thinker in the Board Manager " 1.x.x does not have it.

In order to over come the Code too big - then use the Arduino 2.x IDE.

I did not see the Partition in the Tools submenu drop down.
